# Clinical Language Processing Toolkit CLPT

**Overview**

Clinical Language Processing Toolkit (CLPT) is a framework developed with Python which enables researchers to share their project results easily and supports research to be conducted in a fast and reproducible way. The unified annotation scheme for the CLPT is called the clinical language annotation object (CLAO). You could search/insert/and delete annotations in the CLAO. The CLPT consists of Data Ingestion module, Analysis Engine module, Classification module and Evaluation module.

The CLPT is currently in active development. The current published version mainly focuses on the CLAO annotation creation, searching, insertion and deletion as well as some pre-processing methods. A light Mention Detection function is provided and more comprehensive functions to support classification tasks will be added for future release, including (1) acronym expansion; (2) mention detection; (3) fact extraction; (4) relationship extraction.
